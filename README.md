week3-homework
==============

I am stoked... I struggled initially, but I think I have set up the recognizers enough times to feel good.
I actually rebuilt my file on my home computer, and it all went very quickly the second time.  Then I tried to recreate the video collapse interaction that we have in the YouTube app.
I think mine is better, because the video is mapped to the cursor not some weird line.

The YouTube interaction is after the basic homework assignment in the animated gif.  In the app it is a separate view Controller presented by clicking on the menu of the homework assigment.
